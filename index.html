    <div id="future">

        <h1 id="futureheader">Future?</h1>

        <p>I'm 24 years old. Even though I'm a designer and i look foward to designing the world, and all of it contents, I will differ from what I'm truly great at, people. Whenever I do something in my education,I tend to help people and really enjoy it. Each project, I've been a <em>projectleader</em>. Either it's how I look, or it's my engaging and initiating attitude, that does the trick. I simply love the stress and the process of the projects and what I learn when i lead.
           Whatever I do, working with people are always more relavant and intresting for me than the actual work. I love the process. Here's
           what work I would like to do:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Build an adjustable phone company</li>
          <li>Open a doughnut café</li>
          <li>Build businesses and their social platforms</li>
          <li>Build a thousand websites</li>
          <li>Write a childrens book, based on actual research</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

    <div id="about">

      <h1 id="aboutheader">About</h1>

        <h4>Past</h4>
        <p>Before I began studying multimediadesign at Erhversakedemi Sjælland, I went to a entreprenuerial course down in my hometown Næstved. It was called <em>"Iværksætterne"</em>. This was the first time I met the process of Design Thinking and got knowledge of social media. I began my journey as an entreprenuer. I did more than I thought.</p>

        <h4>Present</h4>
        <p>I'm a student, but I want more than study. Yes I still want to be good at my subjects. Hopefully so good that I won't get limited by myself when I want to do something. No matter the subject, I feel that my talent lies in the communication with others. Whenever and whatever I may do, if being and talking with people are included, I'm happy. There's still some stuff I wan't to get better at:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Business & Entrepreneurship</li>
          <li>Photography & Cinema</li>
          <li>Communication</li>
          <li>Design & Graphics</li>
          <li>Coding</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Passion</h4>
        <p>I have a lot of ideas and dreams. I want to be able to execute and live them. Not for the result, but for the process and the people involved. That's my passion.
        <br><br>
        I'm going to absolutely hustle, ROCK ON and stay true to myself. I'm going to conquer the world being myself.</p>
